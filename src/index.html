                <div id="bioInfo" class="bio-scroll">As a little girl, it was very clear that I had a love for everything
              'outside'. Most of
              that time I spent
              following my mom around in the garden. My childhood consisted of being outside, all day and every day.
              That carried on with me and will for the rest of
              my life. Plainly, I am fascinated with nature, it's honest beauty and yet fierce capacity to simply work.
              I've
              always had an interest insects, horticulture and geology (even paleontology). This led me to the decision
              of
              graduating with a bachelor's from MTSU in Plant and Soil Science. The six years I spent in that field
              were some
              of the best times I have ever had. However, my drive for more was constantly nagging me and the
              realization that
              I was going nowhere in this field was quite evident. My love for nature will never go away; though, it
              was time
              that I pursued one of my other passions. So my journey at NSS began.</p>

              <p>When dial-up was still a thing and monitors were big enough for my cat to sleep on, my love for coding
                began
                to shape. One of my favorite things to do is to write and I found a group of people who enjoyed doing
                it
                as much as
                me. Forums became a staple of our community and with forums came people managing the admin portions,
                including the coding that just about everyone stayed away from. All of
                these characters piqued my interest and I bravely dove into HTML and CSS. I would tie up the telephone
                line
                for hours at a time styling our pages. And even though that particular hobby died down over time, my
                interest in coding never followed that same path. As it came down to what I wanted to do for the rest
                of
                my life (after the
                horticulture route did not go as planned)... the big question of 'What do I want to go back to school
                for
                again?'
                rested heavily on my mind. I couldn't do what I was doing for forever. Funny enough, it was my dad's
                idea
                to look
                into NSS. He is a Project Manager himself and the developing world is not unfamiliar to him. He
                remembered the
                days I had spent on the PC doing similar things. He suggested I take a look and it was one of the best
                decisions I ever made. I took a Jump Start class at NSS for three weeks to test the water. I always
                wanted to
                learn more about developing and I was good with computers. I liked puzzles, solving problems and seeing
                the
                results of something I created by hand and hardwork. This was my path.</p>
