    <!-- TODO: Fill in bio info here: What is your background? Why do you want to go into development? What do you love about development? -->
    <p>As a little girl, it was very clear that I had a love for everything 'outside'. Most of that time I spent following my mom around in the garden. On occasion, attempting to eat a rolly-polly or two. My childhood consisted of being outside, all day and every day. We had a Nintendos and the very first PlayStation (which did start my love for videogaming), but I preferred to play outside. That carried on with me and will for the rest of my life. Plainly, I am fascinated with nature, it's honest beauty and yet fierce capacity to simply work. I've always had an interest insects, horticulture and geology (even paleontology). This led me to the decision of graduating with a bachelor's from MTSU in Plant and Soil Science. The six years I spent in that field were some of the best times I have ever had. However, my drive for more was constantly nagging me and the realization that I was going nowhere in this field was quite evident. My love for nature will never go away; though, it was time that I pursued one of my other passions. So my journey at NSS began.</p>
      
    <p>When dial-up was still a thing and monitors were big enough for my cat to sleep on, my love for coding began to shape. One of my favorite things to do is to write and I found a group of people who enjoyed doing it as much as me, specifically on the topic of the Lord of the Rings. Forums became a staple of our community and with forums came people managing the admin portions, including the coding that just about everyone stayed away from. All of these characters piqued my interest and I bravely dove into JS, HTML and CSS. I would tie up the telephone line for hours at a time styling our pages. And even though that particular hobby died down over time, my interest in coding never followed that same path. As it came down to what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (after the horticulture route did not go as planned)... the big question of 'What do I want to go back to school for again?' rested heavily on my mind. I couldn't do what I was doing for forever. Funny enough, it was my dad's idea to look into NSS. He is a Project Manager himself and the developing world is not unfamiliar to him. He remembered the days I had spent on the PC doing similar things. He suggested I take a look... And it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I took a Jump Start class at NSS for three weeks to test the water. I always wanted to learn more about developing and I was good with computers. I liked puzzles, solving problems and seeing the results of something I created by hand and hardwork. This was my path.</p>
  
    <p>So there's a bit about my history of deciding to go into developing. Or maybe a lot of my history, ha! Before you go, just wait! I'm going to give you just a little bit more about myself. I think it's quite obvious that I love plants and insects. To go along with those, I love: dinosaurs, geology, watching movies, binging shows (my favorite being Parks and Recreation), reading, writing, my pets, cooking and anything food related, cars (more specifically mine, it's a project), comics, videogaming, and there's more but I'm not going to drone on.  I am a bubbly and upbeat person, who was taught by her mother to be kind to everyone. I smile a lot, like all the time. I also like to make people laugh. Laughter makes people feel good and you never know when that little laugh or smile will change a person's day.</p>
