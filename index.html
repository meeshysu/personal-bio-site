    A long time ago, in the days of my teenage years, I found my love for editing code through writing forums. Proboards.com, for instance, were one of the places that helped pique my curiosity about code and styling. I was the one with the most computer background out of my 'roleplaying friends', so I chose to dive into the JS, CSS and HTML side of these forums. Oh the hours I spent designing and editing webpages, including the actual photoshopped banners, buttons, etc. There began my interest and it stayed with me despite my decision to go to Middle Tennessee State University for Plant and Soil Science. One of the reasons that I enjoyed developing so much was the creation of something and to see it unfold after all of the hardwork that I put into it. So after finding out that my career in Horticulture was not necessarily getting me to where I wanted to be, I decided to go back to school for something else that I loved. With the help of some family and friends, I came to the conclusion that developing was the best idea. Not only did I find it fun and liked doing it (which in my opinion is pretty important), I knew I was capable of reaching this goal.
