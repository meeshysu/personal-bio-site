# Personal Bio Site Readme

This project is all about me - not in the selfish kind of way, or at least on purpose. As we progress throughout the year, we will continue to learn software developing. These things that I learn will be implemented into my personal website. This website will build on everything by me for me. In the future, this website will be a good personal reference to who I am, the technologies I have tackled and why I chose this career.
